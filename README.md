# Weather Plotting

Retreiving weather information from wunderground.com, we can plot the data into graphs using matplotlib.

## January 2017

In this file, we retreive the minumum tempature for each day of Januray in 2017 and graph the information on a histogram using matplotlib. To retreive this data, we use the urllib library to request information with the URL provided. I have provided the URL by creating a a for loop to go through every day of January. For each day of January, we call the getTempFromWeb with the URL including the day number.

## Maximum Histogram

In this file, I am doing the same process from the above file. The difference is that I am focusing on the maximum temprature and I am focusing of the years 1990 through 2017.

## Maximum and Minimum

In this file, I am working on the same years as the previous file but looking at bothe the maximum and minimum tempratures of each year.

## Minimum Scatter

Unlike the previous files, this file focuses on how to create a scatter plot of the minimum temparatures using matplotlib. The data used for this file, I am using all of the days in the month of January 2017.

## Temperature Averages

This file simply calculates the average temparatures for all of the days in January 2017.
